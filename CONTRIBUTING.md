-   You have tried all the following (if relevant) and your issue remains:
    -   Make sure you have the right application started.
    -   Make sure the [issue template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) is respected.
    -   Make sure your issue body is readable and [well formatted](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown).
    -   Make sure the application you are using to reproduce the issue has a clean `node_modules` directory, meaning:
        -   no dependencies are linked (e.g. you haven't run `npm link`)
        -   that you haven't made any inline changes to files in the `node_modules` folder
        -   that you don't have any weird global dependency loops. The easiest way to double-check any of the above, if you aren't sure, is to run: `$ rm -rf node_modules && npm cache clear && npm install`.
