We developed the Our Wave Escape Button (available in the bottom right of our website) to help protect our users in unsafe situations. It has been an important part of our platforms ever since. We hope the open source version is helpful for projects seeking to build safer experiences for survivors.

== Description ==

The Escape Button is a simple floating action button that allows users to quickly and safely exit your website in case of emergency. We originally developed this tool to support survivors of sexual and domestic violence and hope it can be useful for the community as well.

The Escape Button is built to handle both situations where the user or browser does not have Javascript enabled and when it does.

It is possible to override the styling of the Escape Button in your own stylesheet.
